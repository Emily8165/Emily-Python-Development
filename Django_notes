Django notes: 

"""
CHAPTER 0:
- to create a file go cd, then desktop then mkdir to create a file directory. 


CHAPTER 1
this is a place for my useful django and big projects notes 

django, you need to restart/activate your vertal enviroment every time. 
CREATE VENV: python -m venv (the venv is the name of your enviroment)
ACTIVATE VENV: source myvenv/bin/activate
DEACTIVATE VENV: type DEACTIVATE
DELETE VENV: rm -r venv

setting up a django project: 
1 - set up vertual enviroment by running the relivent above commands. 
2 - activate said venv 
3 - upgrade pip 
4 - pip install django
5 - django-admin start project <my_project_name>
6 - type project name into the terminal to make sure you are working form it
7 - python manage.py runserver - if this isnt working then go to cd, then desktop, the the project folder, then the django project folder, then the file with the manage.py file in it. 


APP stuff:
- starting an APP
1 - python manage.py startapp <app_name>. this will create a new file in your project file. 

Views: 
- Views are where you store code that does things. 
- They are stored in views.py normally and a file like this is gnerated automatically when you create the app. 
- You will want to return a HTTPs reposen so from django.http import HttpResponse
- Views need to be saved as functions and classes so they can be called specifically in other files such as URLs. 

URLS:
- urls are where the links to various parts of your site are generated. 
- You need to create this file when you start the app.  
- 

Models:
- Models are data tables that exist in a sql server that is autocreated when you start the django proejct. 
- You can create a new tables by adding them as a class to the models file that is auto generated. 
class <name>(models.Model):
  var1 = models.charfield(max_length=255)
  var2 = models.charfield(max_length=255)
- The charfield defines what the type of data in the field/colum is. In this instance it is charactures. which will be a string value.  
- the var are teh variables you are adding into the table. Like columns. 
- Hit python manage.py makemigrations <model_name> to creat the model. 
  - this then creates a stand along file called 0001_initial.py that can be used to track the changes. 
- to create the model type this into the terminal: python manage.py migrate
- to view the sql statement: python manage.py sqlmigrate members 0001

Adding data to the table:
- you need to first of all open up the shell by using python manage.py shell. 
- then you need to import the table to say which one you ar editing: from <name-of-file>.models import <name_of_class_in_models>
- you can view the query table by hitting: <name_of_class>.objects.all()
- to add a new object you need to define it first: object = <class_name>(var1="data1", var2="data2")
- then hit <object>.save()
- then to see the values: <class>.objects.all().values()

Updating data:
- first make sure you have alled teh correct table from <file>.models import <class>
- then call the specific row you want to end. with x = <class>.objects.all()[4]
- then you can return the various columns associated with the row by calling them out x.colum name. 
- to redefine the data in the cell, you need need to write it out again, e.g x.column = <new data>, then hit x.save()

deleting records:
- first make sure you have alled teh correct table from <file>.models import <class>
- then call the specific row you want to end. with x = <class>.objects.all()[5]
- then you can return the various columns associated with the row by calling them out x.colum name.
- then just hit x.delete()

adding fields to the model:
- this part is a bit trickier. 
- you need to open up the the models folder to add the new fields. 
- add in your chnages and then run the python manage.py makemigrations <class_name> to save it. 
- if you run into a problem with you data limits not beind defined just add null=true to them to get round it for now. 

CHAPTER 2
Django templates:
- templates are held as html files typically.
- when djano sees {%%} that means that it is looking for some logic inside the brackets. like an f string. 
  they are called tags.
- as we have added a new template we need to add a new view as well. 
- in this view we need to specify:
  - that the object in the new view has the values associated with that in the models file. So import them. 
  - load the html template you created ("file_name.html")

Add link to details:
- this part will tell you how to add hyper links to you django doc. 
- First define what you want to link to go to. 
  open up a new html doc in templates and put in the content you want. 
- Second add a link to the new doc in your home page doc. 
  this id done by using the <li><a>href="linked_doc.html" </a></li> with text in the middle. 
- Third create a view, for the new page so you can view it. 
  make sure teh loader.get_template has "linked_page.html" in it. 
- Forth add in a new url
  add in the path so path('admin/mainfile/smallfile', views.linked_file.html, name="linked_file")

adding a master template:
- this is a way of creating a parent template which others will link to/ from. 
- first create another html template by name it master. 
- then we need to link the other pages to this by using {%extends%} tags as well as title and content blocks. 
- just make sure you have the links in and you'll be fine. 
- use the extend tags to allow your templates to be tracked and possibly controlled from one logcaiton. 


adding a main index page:
- we first need to define our main page, which people will be directed to once they click the link to our website. 
  call this one main. 
- then you need to create a new view which just returns the main.html page. 
- then add in a URl. It is the main page so just needs path("", views.main, name="main")
- and then you need to link the other pages back to the main one if you feel like it. 
  just put in a <a href="/"> home </a> for this one. 

editing 404 page:
- 404 page is what you get when there is an error and you are not debuging
  the debugging option is in your setting file on your main project file. 
  The allowed admins part need to be filled in wiht ["*"] and the debug needs to be set to false.
- create a 404.html template doc to edit it. 

Adding in a test view:
- add a view in teh views file for testing called testing. 
- add a template.html file which the testing file will route too. 
- add in a url for testing at teh end.
- hsould all work.  

CHAPTER 3
Django admin:
- admin allows you to use a crud interface, Create Read Update Delete. 
- admin comes free and ready to use with django as well. 
- by running the server with /admin/ at the end you can see the admin portal
  requests go to the admin first and then it directs them onto other parts of the site. 

Django admin create a user:
- to create a user run python manage.py createsuperuser in the terminal
- it will then ask you for a username, email address (doesn't have to be real) and a password. 
- then run the server again to see it working. 
- from this site you can create new users/groups 

Django admin - include memeber:
- you first of all need to define an amin interficae. 
  which is done in the admin file that is automatically generated. 
- you need to register the model you are running from here,
  import the model you are using from models. 
  then add - admin.site.register(model)
- this allows you to see the objects that you have created. 

Django Admin - set fields to display:
- on the record object each object is recorded as a string. 
  - We can change this in two ways to make it a bit more reader friendly. 
- change the string representation to a string as __str__() for each object in the models:
  - in models, add def __str__(self):
    return f'{self.column1} {self.colum2}''
    which will call out the columns you want to identify the data as. 
- set the list _details property of the objects model. 
  - we need to go to admin folder and add a new class to help list the display. 
  - class <object>.Admin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ("firstname", "lastname", "joined_date",)

Django Admin - update/add/delete new objects:
- you can add details through the front end to each object you have specified. 
- you can add new objects through the front end as well, just not new fields. 
- to delete memebers, just select then delete. 

CHAPTER 4 - Django Syntax
Django Variables:
    You render variables differently in different files,  
  Template vairables: you can render variables in the template inside of the {{}}, 
    bare in mind you need to include the html tags if you want it to show up on the site. 
  Variables in view: 
    you can find where the variables are in the proejct and edit them there. 
  Creating a variable in template:
    You can re-define variables with the {% with var="var" %} {%endwith%} tags
  Data from a model: 
    most data comes from a model 
    to get data from a model you just need to make sure that it is defined in the model section
    and then called in the template html doc. 
Django Template tags:
  you can use template tags to exect commands such as if statements and forloops. 
  you just need to make sure theya re in the tags so like this - 
  '{% if num == 1 %}'
    <h1>hello</h>
  '{% else %}'
    <h1>bye</h>
  '{% endif %}''
- the django tags are specifically to tell django that there is some logic there other then html
  it allows us to program before we push the html to the client server
- there are lots of tags you can use, you can find more here:
https://www.w3schools.com/django/django_template_tags.php

- for loops are similer so like this:
{% for x in fruits %}
  <h1>{{ x }}</h1>
{% endfor %}

Empty: 
  important to note that if you want to iterate over an empty cell specify with empty. 

Also make sure your html doc has this:
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <body>
  </body>
  </html>
or it wont work. 

if in a html doc you can add {% comment %} comments like that
and in the views you can do it normally with #

{% include 'content' %} is useful for bringing repeated text over from other files. kinda like import. 
This can also be used to bring variables from other docs. 

CHAPTER 5:
Django query set:
- A query set is a collection of data from a database. 
- A QuerySet is built up as a list of objects
- A Query set allows you to filter data and is easier to get data you actually need. 
- We can use the testing view in views.py to test different queries. 

Django queryset - get data:
- values allows you to return each object in a python dictionary
  this comes back as key/values pairs. 
- view_list() allows you to return the column headings specified. 
  model.objects.values_list('firstname')
  so that is how to get some columns
- to get some rows you need to use filter().
  this is written like this model.objects.filter(firstname='Emily').values()

Django queryset - filter:
- the filter takes two arguments, colum and term to serach for, lke this - 
  model.objects.filter(firstname='Emily').values()
  this will return all the rows in colum firstname that have 'emily'
- if you don't know an extact cell to look for. you can use the AND to narrow down teh search. 
  models.objects.filter(lastname='lastname', id=2).values()
  this says find in models all objects in column lastname and have and ID of two, and retrun thier values. 
- to get an OR working, you will need to define the search term agaign. 
  model.objects.filter(firstname='Emily').values()|model.objects.filter(firstname='Alex').values()
  note the '|' as it is weird and you don't use it often.
- to similify things you can use Q expressions. 
  model.objects.filter(Q(firstname='Emily').values()| Q(firstname='Alex')).values()
- feild look ups can be used to find bits of data within cells.
  they are written like this - model.objects.filter(firstname__startswith='E').values()
  this can help find peices of data which you don't know the full information for. 
- there are loads of other field look ups that are like SQL and can be found here: https://www.w3schools.com/django/django_queryset_filter.php

Django QuerySet - order by:
- this is how to order data in django. 
  model.objects.all().order_by('firstname').values()
  which puts everythign in alphabetical order. 
- to change to decending just put in a minus:
  model.objects.all().order_by('-firstname').values()
- to add in multiple orders, just add them in as a kwag into the order_by method.
  model.objects.all().order_by('firstname', '-id).values()

CHAPTER 6
Django - Add a static file:
- this is where we can add css and images.
Create a static folder:
- create a folder named static in the same folder as wehre you cretead you template folders.
- tehn create a css file by doing <name>.css
- next you need to add this to the html template. by adding {% load <foldername> %} at the top. 
  and add the link to this css as well <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'myfirst.css' %}">

Actually getting css to work in django
- turns out django doesn't acutally have a built in method for handling static files <cooooooool>
  you will need to import a third party libary called whitenoise. get it in pip import whitenoise. 
- once you have whitenoise, go to middelware in the settings.py file. 
  then go to middle ware and add this to the list of middlewares: 'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',
- you now need to make sure that all the static files are being collected. 
  to do this you need to go to settings and add this above the STATIC_URL, STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / "productionfiles"
- after this you need to collect the static files by running python manage.py collectstatic in the terminal. 
  this will copy across all static files to the productionfiles in settings. 
- this will finally make the thing work. 
- also worth noting that the productionfiles folder will appear in your main project folder as well. 

adding global static files:
- global static files are static files that can be used across a number of files. 
- in this instance we need to tell django where to look for the static files. 
- first step is to create a root folder for this in the main project. 
- create a css file in it and give it an aciton to do (like tunring the page blue)
- then go to settings and add this under your STATIC_URL line:
  STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    BASE_DIR / 'mystaticfiles'
  ]
    - the STATICFILES_DIRS is the list where django will go to look for all static files. 
    - the BASE_DIR is a keyword that represents the root of the directory in the project
    - the mystaticfiles is the folder in the root directory which will hold our static files. 
  every time you make a change to a static file you will need to run the collectstatic command. 

Chapter 7: PostGreSQL
- Django uses SQLite as a standard but is only really good at testing and debugging. 
  There for we need another database engine for production such as:
  - PostgreSQL
  - MariaDB
  - MySQL
  - Oracle
- PostgreSQL is best as it is an opensource relational databse. 
- To install PostgreSQL you need to install the package:
  pip install psycopg2-binary
  This is the package driver for PostgreSQL and is key to making it work in python. 

- AWS:
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) is where we will host our databases. 
- First go to AWS.amazon.com and create an account
- next you want to add an RDS service - which is a type of database. 

- Now we will create a postgresql database. 
- choose to create a database and select either standard or easy creation. 
  - Standard creation:
    - choose postgresql
    - choose free tier
    - name database (EH-DB), username (EHpostgreSQL) and password (same one as laptop). Doesn't matter what these are. 
    - keep the defualt instance config -> probably burstable classes. 
    - turn off auto scrolling (just not nessersary here)
    - Grant public access (Don't connect to EC2) (public access yes), and create new security group. 
    - keep default db authentications 
    - keep default monitoring
    - then click create

- connect to the database:
  - you need to make sure django can connect to a database by specifcying it in DATABASES tuple in the settings.py file. 
  to do this go to the database tuple and add in the relivent details from you db for it to identify it. 

- postgresql - add members
  - first you need to create a super user by running python manage.py createsuperuser
  - follow the advise and then go to admin and log in using the credencials you added in. 

CHAPTER 8: deploying
- to deploy to prod you need to have a server to host things on. This is the AWS thing. 
- log into AWS. 
- search for elastic beanstalk, we will use this to deploy projects. 
- now we need to lock down the dependencies and get our django project all ready.
